Hi! Im Leo Zorzoli and this is my web application for the Project 2: Flack of CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
My personal touch is that the user can change their name.

- The helpers.py file define a function login required and extends to the application.py file
- Static folder:
    - The channel.js file have the javascript settings
    - The styles.css file have the css settings
- Templates folder:
    - The layout.html is the primary file a extends for the others 
    - The channel.html is the file for the chat
    - The index.html is the file for create a new channel
    - The signin.html is the file for set your username
    - The change.html is for change your username
